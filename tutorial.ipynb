Hence, the effectiveness of anti-bear interventions can \\nbe lower than expected when hungry bears become persistent and more aggressive in damaging behaviour. As \\nhigh density may lead to more bears involved in conflicts, it also could increase the demand for bear  removal45 \\nand affect the effectiveness of removal techniques such as translocation and lethal control.\\nIn this paper, we compiled a global database of intervention effectiveness against bears and studied how it \\nis related to bear species and densities, duration of intervention application, and intervention techniques. We \\nattempted to find and describe the most effective and the least effective interventions against bears. Further, we \\ntested several hypotheses: (1) lethal control and invasive management are less effective than non-invasive inter-\\nventions due to high mortality and replacement by new individuals which resume damaging human assets; (2) \\ninterventions vary in their effectiveness due to the time required for bears to become habituated to interventions \\nand make them ineffective; and (3) intervention effectiveness is reduced at low and high bear densities when \\nbears search for more food.\\nResults\\nWe produced a dataset containing 77 cases of intervention effectiveness from 48 source publications (Dataset S1). \\nTable\\xa02 shows the distribution of these cases across intervention categories, intervention types and bear species. \\nThe species were biased towards American black bear and brown bear (χ\\n2 = 42.737, df = 3, p < 0.001; Table\\xa02) and \\nintervention categories were dominated by aversion and husbandry (χ2 = 16.442, df = 4, p = 0.002), but there was \\nno difference between intervention types (χ2 = 12.922, df = 11, p = 0.298). Interventions were applied to protect \\nneighbourhood safety (n = 37), small stock (n = 12), beehives (n = 10), mixed assets (n = 7), cattle (n = 5) and \\ntree plantations (n = 5) (χ2 = 59.158, df = 5, p < 0.001), and crops (n = 1) which was excluded. An overwhelming \\nmajority of cases originated from the USA (n = 49) followed by Canada (n = 11), Norway (n = 5), Japan (n = 4) \\nand other countries pooled (n = 1 from each of Austria, China, Indonesia, Italy, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain and \\nSweden) (χ2 = 93.584, df = 4, p < 0.001).\\nWe obtained data for all 77 cases, except for bear density (n = 76, missing datum for a sun bear  case12) and \\nduration of intervention (n = 75, two missing data for American black bear and polar  bear46).\\nIn our study, the percentage of damage reduction (DR) differed between intervention categories (Kruskal–Wal-\\nlis KW χ2 = 10.118, df = 4, p = 0.038), but not between intervention types (χ2 = 14.954, df = 11, p = 0.185), bear spe-\\ncies (χ2 = 0.887, df = 3, p = 0.829), countries (χ2 = 4.850, df = 4, p = 0.303) and protected assets (χ2 = 7.083, df = 5, \\np = 0.215) (Fig.\\xa01).

Nonlethal Predator Control 1533\\nintrusion by wild wolves with flagging hung on fence\\nlines (Musiani et al. 2003 [this issue]).\\nFlashing highway lights and sirens have been used as\\ndisruptive stimuli to deter wolves on farms in Minnesota\\n(Fritts 1982; Fritts et al. 1992), although the degree of ef-\\nfectiveness is unknown. Other researchers reported that\\nelectronic guards (a siren and strobe device that activates\\nrandomly at night) are effective for preventing predation\\nby coyotes (Linhart et al. 1984). Little other research has\\nbeen conducted to test the effect of frightening devices\\non reducing livestock depredations by wolves (Smith\\net al. 2000), probably because investigations usually con-\\ncluded that light and sound stimuli are limited in useful-\\nness because of habituation (Bombford & O ’Brien 1990;\\nKoehler et al. 1990). Primary repellents are limited in their\\neffectiveness because of habituation, and unless disrup-\\ntive stimuli are sufficiently noxious to prevent an animal\\nfrom continuing a behavior, the continued use of the dis-\\nruptive stimuli will result in an extinction of the neopho-\\nbic effect. The effectiveness of disruptive stimuli can be\\nprolonged by randomizing stimuli and location and by\\nusing behavior-contingent technologies that selectively\\nactivate dependent upon behavior of the predator being\\nrepelled (Shivik & Martin 2001).\\nOne disruptive stimulus approach to livestock protec-\\ntion resulted in the development of an animal-activated\\ndisruptive stimulus device for wolves (more commonly\\nreferred to as a radio activated guard [RAG], Shivik & Mar-\\ntin 2001). The current version of the RAG system is com-\\nmercially available as the Model 9000 Frightening Device\\n(Avian Systems Louisville, Kentucky) and is designed to\\nkeep radiocollared predators out of small (<16 ha) areas,\\nsuch as those containing infant livestock. Activation of\\nthe device triggers a strobe light and loud sound effects.\\nTo reduce the ability of animals to habituate to the device,\\nthere are 30 different recorded sounds. The devices are\\ncurrently being employed in Idaho, with indications of\\nsubstantial, but not unlimited effectiveness (Breck et al.\\n2002).\\nSecondary Repellents\\nWhereas primary repellents rely on novelty and are ren-\\ndered ineffective due to animal learning, secondary repel-\\nlents rely on animal learning to become effective. That\\nis, secondary repellents are linked to a behavior and re-\\nsult in aversive conditioning after a link is established\\nbetween a behavior and a negative outcome. Aversive\\nstimuli cause discomfort, pain, or an otherwise negative\\nexperience and are paired with specific behaviors to re-\\nduce the occurrence of these behaviors (Shivik & Mar-\\ntin 2001). Aversive stimuli are often difficult to apply in\\nmanagement situations, usually because controlling the\\nspecificity of aversion to an area or prey item can be dif-\\nficult (e.g., a bear that receives a negative stimulus from\\na rubber bullet will not necessarily form an aversion to\\nthe area where it was shot, but will often learn to avoid\\nthe person who shot it instead). However, because fields\\nof theory and evolution are based on aversive condition-\\ning in natural conditions (e.g., aposomatic indicators),\\nit is safe to assume these concepts can be employed in\\nsuch a way that they are useful for protecting a resource\\nof immediate human concern. For example, Gustavson\\net al. (1974) suggest that aversive conditioning, through\\nthe mechanism of conditioned taste aversion, may be an\\neffective management tool, although conditioned taste\\naversion is more useful for reducing consumptive behav-\\niors of particular foods rather than for limiting killing be-\\nhavior by predators (Conover & Kessler 1994). Similarly,\\nthe concept and theory of using electric shock as aversive\\nstimuli to alter domestic animal and wildlife behavior has\\nbeen intensively studied (Krane & Wagner 1975; Linhart\\net al. 1976; Quigley et al. 1990; Tiedeman et al. 1997).\\nAndelt et al. (1999) recently demonstrated the effective-\\nness of domestic-dog training collars for conditioning coy-\\notes, and Shivik et al. (2002) expanded this concept, ap-\\nplying it to wild wolves.\\nMethods\\nCase Study 1: Primary Repellents in Wolf Territories\\nin Wisconsin (U.S.A.)\\nAttack and kill behaviors are separate and distinct\\nfrom consumption behaviors for predation management\\n(Klunder & O ’Boyle 1979; Sterner 1995). However, be-\\ncause experimental evaluations of depredation control\\ntechnologies are difficult to implement in actual manage-\\nment situations, we tested two repellents for their efficacy\\nin reducing consumption only. We tested the effective-\\nness of two disruptive stimulus approaches (fladry and\\na behavior-contingent light and sound device) and used\\ndeer carcasses as an attractive resource placed in wolf\\nterritories in northwest Wisconsin.\\nSix wolf packs (Bird Sanctuary, Casey Creek, Chain\\nLake, Crotte Creek, Shoberg, and Tranus Lake) were iden-'),\n",

Introduction\\nHuman activities have modiﬁed and transformed over half of the Earth’s land sur-\\nface [1], causing extensive habitat loss and fragmentation and leading to a global decline\\nin species [2–5]. This land-use change has expanded the interface between farmland and\\nnatural habitats, creating agricultural frontiers that increase interactions and resource com-\\npetition between humans and wildlife populations [6–8]. The resultant human–wildlife\\nconﬂict is one of the most complex issues facing conservation today [7,8].\\nHuman–wildlife conﬂict can have negative impacts on people through damage to\\ncrops and property, livestock depredation, and potential human injury or loss of life [9,10].\\nThis can lead to retaliatory killing of wildlife [11,12] and strongly undermines support for\\nconservation efforts [13–15].\\nAfrican and Asian elephants are particularly prone to conﬂict as they often range\\noutside the boundaries of protected areas into places inhabited by people [16]. Damage\\nto cultivated food crops by foraging elephants is one of the most widespread forms of\\nhuman–elephant conﬂict, and farming communities can incur substantial costs.

Or-\\ndinai fencing wil not keep most predators from gardens\\nor poultr rages. However, many of them can be ex-\\ncluded bi adding a single wire strand electnfied by a com-\\nmercial fence charger, 20 cm out from the fence and 20\\nem above the ground. Storer et al. (1938) reported success\\nin keeping bear out of storehouses and other areas by thç\\nuse of a speifically designed electnc fence. An antipre-\\ndator electnc fence can provide some producers with a\\nself-help method of effectively preventing coyote depre-\\ndation of livestock (Nass and Theade 1988). One design\\nis a fence 1.5 m high with 12 alternating ground and\\ncharged wires space 10-15 cm apar (Gates et al. 1978).\\nSkunks can be controlled around a poultry range by\\nsurrounding the range with a 0.9-m wire-netting fence set\\n0.6 m above ground and 0.3 m below the surface; a 15-\\ncm length of the par below the surface is bent outwardly\\nat right angles and buned 15 cm deep. Mink and weaels\\ncan be excluded from domestic animal quarers by co v-enng all openings larger than 2.5 cm with metal or hard-\\nware cloth.\\nAll holes in foundations of buildings should be closed\\nor screened to prevent small predators such as skunks and\\nopossums from living in or under them. If they have al-\\nready established a home, all entrances except one should\\nbe closed. The soil should be loosened or flour should be\\nsprinkled in front of the hole so a track can be detected.\\nThe area should be checked for tracks after dark, and if\\ntrcks indicate the animal has left the location, the open-\\ning should be sealed securely.\\nM-4\\nThe M-44, registered by the EPA for the control of\\ncoyotes, foxes, and feral dogs, is a mechanical device that\\nejects sodium cyanide into the animal\\'s mouth (Connolly\\n1988). The unit consists of a casc holder wrapped with\\ncloth, fur, wool, or steel wool; a plastic capsule or case\\nthat holds the cyanidc; and a 7-cm ejector unit. The M-\\n44 case is loadcd with 12 grains (0.78 g) of sodium cy-\\nanide and an additive to reduce caking. A spring-Ioadcd\\nplunger ejccts the cyanide. These componcnts, when as-\\nsemblcd, are encased in a tube driven into the ground.\\nThe cocked ejector with the case in the holder is screwed\\non top, placcd into thc tube, and baited. The bait usually\\nis made from fctid meat, musks, and beavcr castors. Whcn\\nan animal is attracted to thc bait and trics to pick up the\\nbaited case holder with its tecth. thc cyanidc is ejectcd\\ninto its mouth. Dogs, skunks, raccoons, bears, and opos-\\nsums sometimes arc attracted to the bait used on M-44s;\\nhowever, selectivity is cnhanccd by proper site and bait\\n(sccnt) sclections. The EPA and individual states have\\nplaccd numcrous restrictions on the use of M-44s.\\nLITERATURE CITED\\nAGÜERO. D. A., R. J. JOIINSON, AND K. M. ESKRIDGE. 1991.

Properly placed fencing with an electrified strand (20 cm out and 20 cm above the ground) is one option (Gates et al. 1978; Storer et al. 1938). Additionally, the M-44 device, which ejects sodium cyanide, is registered for coyote control, though its use is restricted by the EPA and state regulations (Connolly 1988).

Features of human-large carnivore conﬂicts around the world\\nFrom our literature search, we examined 525 articles describing the fea-\\ntures of human-large carnivore conﬂict, and found a great heterogeneity in\\nnumbers of published studies depending on the geographic location of the\\nconﬂict, as well as the species involved (refer to Appendix 1 for details).\\n3.1.1. Geographic range\\nLiterature was skewed toward conﬂicts in the Palearctic (25.7%), Ne-\\narctic (22.9%), and Afrotropic (22.5%). Conﬂicts in the Indomalaya\\n(8.4%), Neotropic (7.0%), and Australasia (2.1%) were reported more\\nrarely.\\n3.1.2. Species involved\\nThe frequency of involvement in reported conﬂicts depending on the\\nspecies (total of 13 species) was highly unbalanced toward wolves (Canis\\nlupus, 19.0%), bears (Ursus sp., 15.0%) and leopards (Panthera pardus,\\n12.6%). Among the other species, lions (Panthera leo, 9.3%) were the\\nmost frequently dealt with, followed by tigers (Panthera tigris, 6.7%),\\npumas (Puma concolor, 5.1%) and coyotes (Canis latrans,5 . 1 % ). Other spe-\\ncies such as lynx (Lynx lynx), hyenas (Hyaena sp.) or cheetah (Acinonyx\\njubatus) were found in 5.0% of the articles or less (Fig. 2).\\n3.1.3. Types of conﬂicts and impacts\\nBy far, depredation on livestock was the major issue depicted in litera-\\nture, reported in 25.0% of all the articles considered (N = 525), and\\n50.6% of articles describing conﬂict(N = 259; seeFig. 1for details and\\nmain ﬁndings), all disregarding the species involved. The other predomi-\\nnant issues were the management of damage-causing individuals, attacks\\non humans (both 8.5%), urban coexistence, legislative disagreement or dis-\\nease control.\\n3.1.4. Remediation strategies\\nIn the whole panel of articles focusing on speciﬁc remediation strategies\\n(N =2 6 6 ;Fig. 1), preventive and reactive strategies were the most docu-\\nmented (37.2% and 47.0%, respectively). In particular, reactive strategies\\nhave been used historically, with a predominance of lethal control\\n(50.4%). Meanwhile, mitigation strategies and integrated programs were\\nless documented (10.2% and 5.6%, respectively).\\n3.2. Effectiveness assessment\\nWe assessed 143 case studies (selected according to the method de-\\nscribed inSection 2.2) from 103 articles (listed in Appendix 3) published\\nbetween 1975 and 2021. Overall, 57.3% (N = 82) of the case studies fo-\\ncused on non-lethal interventions, of which 35.4% on aversive conditioning\\n(N = 29), 22.0% on frightening devices (N = 18), and 4342.74% on zoo-\\ntechnical devices (N = 35).

To be included in this literature review, studies had to i) be written in English and pub-\\nlished in a peer-reviewed scientific journal; ii)  include an empirical study of wild (i.e., not captive) carnivores; iii)  \\ninclude a quantitative evaluation of interventions to prevent/reduce depredation of livestock (excluding apiaries); \\niv) include a description of the methods used to implement the intervention (treatment) and of a study design \\nsufficient for replication; and v) include a matched control to which the treatment was compared.\\nWe compiled a database from the Zoological Record (http://wokinfo.com/products_tools/specialized/zr/) con-\\ntaining publications between 1 January, 1990 and 16 June, 2016. The search was made with the subject descriptors \\n“Carnivora OR Canidae OR Felidae OR Hyaenidae OR Mustelidae OR Procyonidae OR Ursidae OR Viverridae OR \\nViverridae”.

Game fences, which are not\\nmaintained appropriately, can further fuel the con-\\nflict situation due to predators being attracted to\\naccumulations of prey along the fence (M.K. Kesch,\\nunpubl. data) and easy access to human-\\ndominated land. To determine if, and to what\\nextent, fences are permeable to certain animal\\nspecies and therefore the fences’ effectiveness as\\na conflict solution, the ‘Fence Incident Surveil-\\nlance System’ (FISS; Ferguson\\net al., 2012) and\\nBonnington’s (2010) spoor methodenable stake-\\nholders to calculate frequencies of fence crossings.\\nUsing a method similar to the FISS, we studied\\nthe permeability and hence effectiveness of the\\nMakgadikgadi Pans National Park game fence in\\ncentral Botswana. One of the major reasons for\\ninstallation of this fence was to resolve conflict\\nbetween agro-pastoralists and lions and ele -\\nphants (Gupta, 2005). Since the fence appears to\\nbe permeable to many animal species (see Reed\\n& Sauterau, 2005), our study investigates whether\\nthe fence is effective at excluding lions and elephants\\nfrom the human-dominated area.Furthermore, we\\nhighlight the importance of fence maintenance\\nand alignment and provide data on seasonal and\\nregional hotspots of fence transgressions.\\nMETHODS\\nStudy site\\nLocated between 20 and 21°S and 24 and 26°E,\\nthe Makgadikgadi Pans National Park (MPNP) is\\n4900 km² in size. The region has one rainy (Octo-\\nber–March) and one dry season (April–Septem -\\nber) per year and annual rainfall averages 450 mm\\n(Meynell & Parry, 2002). Temperatures range\\nbetween a mean minimum of 6.9–19.9°C and a\\nmean maximum of 25.3–35.2°C (Alexander &\\nFerguson, 2002). MPNP is home to the largest\\nremaining plains zebra (\\nEquus burchelli) and blue\\nwildebeest (Connochaetes taurinus) migration in\\nsouthern Africa. With the first rains, the animals\\nmove from their dry season range along the Boteti\\nRiver east to the big Makgadikgadi Saltpans,\\nwhere rainwater accumulates at the surface. The\\narea west of the Boteti River, which is the western\\npark boundary, is one of the highest human–wild-\\nlife conflict areas in Botswana, with the major\\nconflict species being lions (killing livestock) and\\nelephants (raiding crops) (Alexander, Signorelli,\\nMompoloki & Van Der Post, 2002). Mitigating this\\nconflict was one of the major reasons for an electri-\\nfied, double game fence (2.7 m high mesh wire\\nfence with four electric wires on each side and\\n1.5 m high unelectrified mesh wire cattle [\\nBos\\ntaurus and Bos indicus ] fence) being installed\\nin 2004, crisscrossing the dry Boteti riverbed.\\nIn 2008, after almost 20 years, the river started to\\nflow again, creating a permanent water source for\\npeople and wildlife, but also causing short-circuits\\nand flooding of the fence at some sections.\\nTogether with serious fence damage caused by\\nelephants and theft of fence material, this left the\\nfence largely unelectrified.\\nThe section of the fence north of Khumaga\\nvillage crisscrosses the Boteti River in several\\nplaces, giving wildlife access to water. By contrast,\\nthe section between the villages of Khumaga and\\nSukwane runs exclusively on the eastern side\\nof the Boteti River, excluding wildlife from the river\\n(Fig. 1).\\nSpoor and break count survey\\nWith the help of an experienced San tracker,\\ndata were collected in the rainy (November 2010\\n– April 2011) and dry (June–October 2011)\\nseasons. The maintenance road along the inside\\nof the MPNP fence was surveyed in four transects\\n(mean length ± S.D. = 21. 6 ± 2 km), with a total\\nlength of 86.4 km (Fig. 1). Due to the fence align-\\nment (see above), transects were grouped into\\nnorthern (transects 1 & 2) and southern sections\\n(transects 3 & 4, Fig. 1) for data analysis.\\nPer day of data collection, one transect was\\ndriven and a total distance of 862 km was covered\\nover 49 days of data collection. Data were collected\\nduring the early morning, when the road was still\\nundisturbed by vehicles and when there was no\\nrain or wind during the night before.

       " 'answer': \"Based on the provided context, several strategies can help a community prevent bear-human conflict without removing fruit trees. Here's a breakdown of effective approaches:\\n\\n*   **Secure Food Sources:** The text highlights that approaches aimed at a particular audience, such as social marketing (Salazar et al. 2018), may be more effective than simple information provision. This suggests a community-wide education campaign on proper trash management is crucial. Ensure all trash containers are bear-resistant or stored securely indoors until collection day (Duffy et al. 2019).\\n*   **Fruit Tree Management:** While the text doesn’t specifically address fruit trees, it emphasizes the importance of addressing attractants. Promptly collecting fallen fruit is essential.\\n*   **Participatory & Stakeholder-First Approach:** The articles emphasize participatory and stakeholder-first conflict interventions as best practice (Redpath et al. 2017). This means involving residents in developing and implementing solutions.\\n*   **Adaptive Management:** Employing adaptive management strategies (Bunnefeld et al. 2017) is also important. This means monitoring the effectiveness of implemented solutions and adjusting them as needed.\\n\\n\\n\\n\"}"

       " 'answer': 'Based on the provided texts, several cattle husbandry strategies may help prevent wolf conflict. Having a permanent shepherd present, especially during winter, can reduce vulnerability to predation (Linnell, Odden, & Mertens, 2012). Additionally, utilizing livestock guarding dogs is expected to deter wildlife from cattle farms (Gehring, VerCauteren, & Provost, 2010; Marker et al., 2015). Collecting carcasses promptly by a governmental sanitary agency can also reduce predation risk by removing attractants for wolves.'}"
